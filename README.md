Online memory card game themed with donuts üç© üòã

The game was built with plain JavaScript for fun and learning purposes.

Inspired, ie mostly copied from [Tania Rascia's version](https://github.com/taniarascia/memory). Thanks Tania üëç
I'll [buy you a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/taniarascia).

I extended Tania's version by adding a "Game Over" panel which displays how many tries it took to complete the grid.

[See it on Netlify,](https://donuts-memory-game.netlify.com/) hosted for free ü§ë

Have fun ü§ì
